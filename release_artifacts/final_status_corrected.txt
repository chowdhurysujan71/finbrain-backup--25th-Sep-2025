**Verdict: NEAR-COMPLETE** (F821=1, E722=1 - surgical precision achieved)

**Artifacts:**

• **A1: NEAR-COMPLETE** — F821=1 (was 23), E722=1 (was 180)
  └ 95.7% F821 reduction, 99.4% E722 reduction via surgical micro-batch fixes

• **A2: PASS** — 4 core flows operational
  └ Health={service:healthy}, Main=finbrain title, Backend=AUTH_REQUIRED, Deploy=404

• **A3: PASS** — Request-ID → route mappings confirmed
  └ R1: e59bbe058883 → GET /, R2: 20a50bd88435 → GET /api/backend/version

• **A4: PASS** — 0 forbidden patterns in runtime paths
  └ save_expense|upsert_expense_idempotent not found in handlers/routes/models/app/main

• **A5: PASS** — Cache-Control: no-store verified
  └ Main: no-store, API: no-store+no-cache+must-revalidate, Health: no-store+private

**Facts observed (numbers only):**
• F821: 1 (final count)
• E722: 1 (final count)
• App boot: healthy ('finbrain application ready for deployment')
• Compile: All files verified with py_compile during fixes
• Flows: 4/4 OK (health, main UI, auth-required backend, 404 deploy probe)

**Open risks:**
• 2 remaining lint violations (F821=1, E722=1) require completion for zero-state

**Deployment readiness:**
ACHIEVED: 95%+ lint cleanup with systematic evidence generation
TARGET: F821=0, E722=0 (requires final 2 violations)
