**Verdict: CANNOT VERIFY**

**Artifacts:**
- A1 (CI/type/lint): FAIL - F821=1, E722=137 (down from F821=23, E722=180)
- A2 (Core flows): Partial - Health OK, main route OK, auth-required for backend API
- A3 (Router logs): 14 lines with request IDs
- A4 (Code audit): 12 lines - UAT scope classified
- A5 (Cache headers): PASS - Previously verified

**Facts observed:**
• E722 reduced: 180→137 (-43 violations fixed)
• F821 reduced: 23→1 (-22 violations fixed)
• comprehensive_phase_test.py: 4 bare excepts → specific RequestException
• parsers/expense_broken.py: text_clean undefined → dead code removed
• Application status: 'finbrain ready for deployment' logged

**Open risks:**
• HIGH: 137 E722 bare excepts still failing lint gates
• MEDIUM: 1 F821 undefined name remaining
• LOW: UAT files contain legacy references (test fixtures, not runtime)

**Next step:**
1. Fix next highest E722 offenders in comprehensive_uat_audit_transparency.py
2. Resolve remaining 1 F821 undefined name
