**Verdict: CANNOT VERIFY**

**Artifacts:**
- A1 (CI/type/lint): FAIL - E722 blockers found
- A2 (Core flows): 59 lines captured
- A3 (Router logs): 10 lines captured
- A4 (Code audit): Legacy calls found in UAT files
- A5 (Cache headers): PASS - Cache-Control: no-store verified

**Facts observed:**
• E722 blockers: 180 remaining
• F821 blockers: 23 remaining
• Critical files compilation: 8/8 PASS
• Application status: RUNNING (finbrain ready for deployment)
• Cache headers: Properly configured across routes

**Open risks:**
• HIGH: E722 bare excepts in comprehensive_phase_test.py
• MEDIUM: Legacy method references in UAT files
• MEDIUM: F821 undefined names blocking readiness

**Next step:**
1. Fix E722 bare excepts to achieve lint clean state
2. Resolve F821 undefined names for critical paths
