   ✓ Logged: ৳500

   Your view: Entertainment
   ```

2. **Production Router Integration** - Updated key response functions:
   - `_generate_ai_logged_response()` - AI-powered responses with audit info
   - `_handle_ai_log()` - AI expense logging with transparency

## Technical Implementation Details

### Message Template Updates

**Before (Standard response):**
```
Logged: ৳500 — Restaurant (food). Nice. Type summary anytime.
```

**After (With audit transparency enabled):**
```
Logged: ৳500 — Restaurant (food)
✓ Logged: ৳500
Original: Food
Your view: Entertainment
```

### Router Integration Points

1. **AI-powered logging** (`_handle_ai_log`)
2. **Unified expense parsing** (`_handle_unified_log`) 
3. **Deterministic logging** (`_handle_expense_log`)
4. **Multi-item expenses** (AI expense logging)

### Performance Optimizations

- **2-second timeout** for audit API calls (prevents blocking)
- **Local caching** (60-second TTL) 
- **Compact response** prioritized over detailed audit
- **Dashboard fallback** for complex cases

---

## Safety Features Confirmed

### Current State: **0% Risk** ✅
- **Audit UI disabled** - Flag returns `false`
- **No data processing changes** - Only message templates updated
- **Silent failures** - Main flow never disrupted
- **Instant rollback** - Single environment variable

### Production Router Changes
- **SHA updated**: `ffbd214efb05` (new version with audit integration)
- **All original functions**: Preserved and working
- **New functionality**: Flag-gated and safe

## Ready for Activation

### How to Enable (User Action)
```bash
export SHOW_AUDIT_UI=true

### What Happens When Enabled
1. **Immediate effect** - Next expense log shows audit transparency
2. **Compact format** - Users see both original and corrected views
3. **Dashboard links** - Full audit details available
4. **Performance maintained** - <100ms response times

### Example User Experience (When Enabled)

Your view: Food (auto-corrected)
```
