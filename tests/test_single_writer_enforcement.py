Anti-Regression Tests for Single Writer Principle Enforcement

This comprehensive test suite ensures that:
1. Only backend_assistant.add_expense() can write to expenses table
2. Runtime protections block unauthorized writes
3. CI tripwires catch forbidden patterns
4. Canonical writer context works correctly
