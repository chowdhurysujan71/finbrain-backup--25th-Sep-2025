## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow (Current & Future Users)
```
Facebook Webhook → Original PSID Received → Background Processor
    ↓
User Hash Generated → Data Processing & Retrieval → Response Generated
    ↓
Original PSID Used → Facebook Message Delivery → User Receives Summary
```

### Deployment Safety Features
- **Fail-Safe Design:** Errors in processing don't break message delivery
