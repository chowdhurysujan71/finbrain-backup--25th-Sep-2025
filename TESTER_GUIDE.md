# FinBrain AI Features - Tester Guide

## Overview
FinBrain now includes advanced AI features that make expense tracking more intelligent and user-friendly. All improvements are **prompt-only** (no code changes) for maximum stability.

## ðŸ”¥ New AI Features to Test

### 1. **Smart Currency Support**
**Default:** BDT (à§³) - but recognizes 5 major currencies
**Test Messages:**
- `"coffee 150"` â†’ Should show à§³150 
- `"lunch $25"` â†’ Should show $25 (preserves currency)
- `"groceries â‚¬30"` â†’ Should show â‚¬30
- `"transport Â£15"` â†’ Should show Â£15
- `"dinner â‚¹200"` â†’ Should show â‚¹200

### 2. **Structured 3-Line Replies** 
**Pattern:** Acknowledge â†’ Insight â†’ Next Action
**Test Messages:**
- `"spent 120 on coffee"` 
- Should get: âœ… Acknowledgment + helpful insight + suggested next step
- Look for consistent 3-line structure in all responses

### 3. **Smart Time Queries with Date Echo**
**Test Messages:**
- `"show me this week"` â†’ Should show "(Aug 19â€“25)" or current week
- `"last month spending"` â†’ Should show "(Jul 1â€“31)" or previous month  
- `"how much today"` â†’ Should show specific date
- `"yesterday spending"` â†’ Should show previous date

### 4. **Budget Context (when available)**
**Test if you have budgets set:**
- Any expense logging should show: `"Food: à§³240 / à§³500 / à§³260 left"`
- Over-budget should show: `"Transport: à§³320 / à§³250 / à§³70 over"`

### 5. **Micro-Trends Detection**
**Test:** Log 3+ similar expenses in one week
- `"coffee 120"` (1st time)
- `"coffee 140"` (2nd time) 
- `"coffee 130"` (3rd time)
- `"coffee 150"` (4th time) â†’ Should mention "That's your 4th coffee this week (à§³540 total)"

### 6. **Duplicate Message Protection**
**Test:** Send the exact same message twice within 5 minutes
- `"coffee 150"`
- Wait 2 minutes, send `"coffee 150"` again
- Should ask: "Looks like a repeatâ€”already logged at [time]. Log again?"
- Reply `"yes"` to confirm

### 7. **Subscription Overview**
**Test Messages:**
- `"show my subscriptions"`
- `"subscription list"`  
- Should show: count, monthly total, top 3 by cost
- May suggest "Need to cancel/mute any?" if total is high

### 8. **Professional Tone & Clean Merchant Names**
**Test Messages:**
- `"SBUX 180"` â†’ Should show "Starbucks" in response
- `"McD 250"` â†’ Should show "McDonald's" in response
- `"WF 500"` â†’ Should show "Whole Foods" in response
- Tone should be encouraging, never judgmental

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: New User Experience**
```
1. "spent 150 on lunch"
2. "coffee 120"  
3. "show me today"
4. "coffee 140" (should be 2nd coffee)
5. "coffee 130" (should be 3rd coffee)
6. "coffee 125" (should trigger micro-trend detection)
```

### **Scenario 2: Multi-Currency User**
```
1. "lunch $25 in NYC"
2. "coffee à§³120 back home"
3. "groceries â‚¬45 in Berlin"
4. "show me this week"
```

### **Scenario 3: Time & Budget Tracking**
```
1. "how much yesterday"
2. "show last week"
3. "this month total"  
4. Check if budget context appears in responses
```

### **Scenario 4: Duplicate Prevention**
```
1. "transport 90"
2. Immediately send "transport 90" again
3. Should get duplicate warning
4. Reply "yes" to confirm
```

## âœ… Expected Improvements

**Before:** Basic expense logging with simple confirmations
**After:** 
- âœ… Intelligent currency handling
- âœ… Consistent 3-line response structure  
- âœ… Date-aware queries with explicit ranges
- âœ… Budget progress tracking
- âœ… Spending pattern recognition
- âœ… Duplicate prevention
- âœ… Professional, encouraging tone
- âœ… Clean merchant name display

## ðŸš¨ What to Report

**Good Signs:**
- Responses follow 3-line pattern consistently

- Professional, helpful tone throughout

**Issues to Flag:**
- Inconsistent response structure

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Testing Tips

1. **Mix currencies** - Test with different symbols in same session
2. **Create patterns** - Buy coffee/transport multiple times to trigger micro-trends
3. **Test edge cases** - Try sending same message twice quickly
4. **Check consistency** - All responses should feel professionally written
5. **Time queries** - Use various time expressions (today, this week, last month)
