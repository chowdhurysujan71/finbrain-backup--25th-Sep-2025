**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**System**: FinBrain Expense Tracker with Gemini AI  
**Environment**: Development/Staging  

## Key Components Tested

### âœ… CORE FUNCTIONALITY
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Gemini 2.5-flash-lite model working with ~2s response times
- **AI-First Routing**: Smart categorization with deterministic fallback
- **Runtime Controls**: Instant AI enable/disable via `/ops/ai/toggle`
- **Rate Limiting**: 2 messages/min per user, 10/min global limits active

### âœ… SECURITY & ADMIN
- **Admin Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth protecting all admin endpoints
- **Webhook Security**: X-Hub-Signature-256 verification enforced
- **HTTPS Ready**: Production security configurations in place
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full access to system monitoring and controls

### âœ… MONITORING & TELEMETRY
