# Migration Recovery Documentation

Generated: 2025-09-14 06:33:56

This document provides manual recovery procedures for irreversible database migrations.
**CRITICAL**: These migrations cannot be automatically rolled back through Alembic.

## ⚠️ EMERGENCY CONTACTS
- **Database Administrator**: [Contact Info]
- **System Administrator**: [Contact Info]  
- **DevOps Team**: [Contact Info]
- **Emergency Escalation**: [Contact Info]

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE RECOVERY STEPS

If you need to recover from a failed irreversible migration:

1. **STOP ALL APPLICATION INSTANCES** immediately
2. **DO NOT** attempt additional migrations
3. Contact the database administrator
4. Refer to the specific migration recovery plan below
5. Execute backup restoration procedures if necessary

---

## ✅ NO IRREVERSIBLE MIGRATIONS

Currently, no irreversible migrations have been detected in this project.
All migrations have proper downgrade paths.

This is the recommended state - maintain reversible migrations whenever possible.

## 📚 GENERAL RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Backup Strategy Requirements

For any future irreversible migrations, ensure the following backups are available:

1. **Full Database Backup**
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Schema-Only Backup**
   ```bash
   pg_dump --schema-only $DATABASE_URL > schema_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

3. **Critical Data Export**
   ```bash
   # Export critical business data
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\copy users TO 'users_backup.csv' CSV HEADER"
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\copy expenses TO 'expenses_backup.csv' CSV HEADER"
   ```

### Emergency Contacts & Procedures

1. **Escalation Path**
   - L1: Development Team
   - L2: Database Administrator
   - L3: System Administrator
   - L4: Emergency On-Call

2. **Communication Protocol**
   - Notify all stakeholders immediately
   - Document all recovery actions taken
   - Post-mortem required for all recovery incidents

### Prevention Best Practices

1. **Migration Design**
   - Avoid irreversible migrations when possible
   - Use data migration scripts for complex transformations
   - Test migrations thoroughly on staging environment

2. **Backup Validation**
   - Test backup restoration procedures regularly
   - Verify backup integrity before production deployments
   - Automate backup creation for migration workflows

3. **Rollback Planning**
   - Document rollback procedures before migration
   - Test rollback procedures on staging environment
   - Have emergency contacts readily available
