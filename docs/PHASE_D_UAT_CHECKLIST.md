# Phase D PWA Shell - UAT Checklist

## Overview
This checklist validates the complete PWA Shell implementation for FinBrain Phase D. All features follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) design principles with zero risk to existing functionality.

## ✅ Infrastructure & Architecture

### PWA Blueprint Registration
- [x] **Blueprint created**: `pwa_ui.py` with safe route registration
- [x] **App integration**: Blueprint safely registered in `app.py` without affecting existing routes
- [x] **Route isolation**: All new routes use `/chat`, `/report`, `/profile`, `/challenge`, `/offline` paths
- [x] **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation if PWA features unavailable

### Static Assets Pipeline
- [x] **CSS Framework**: Complete HIG-inspired design system at `/static/css/app.css`
- [x] **Service Worker**: Caching and offline functionality at `/static/js/sw.js`
- [x] **PWA JavaScript**: Install prompts and offline detection at `/static/js/pwa.js`
- [x] **Icons**: PWA-compliant icons at 192x192 and 512x512 resolutions
- [x] **Manifest**: Generated dynamically via blueprint route `/manifest.webmanifest`

## ✅ User Interface & Experience
