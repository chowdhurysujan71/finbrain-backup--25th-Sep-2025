# WIP Chat System - Current State
**Generated:** 2025-09-08 07:34 UTC  
**Context:** Pre-freeze documentation for checkpoint D9

## Chat-Related Files
| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `pwa_ui.py` | ❌ Problematic | Contains `/ai-chat` and `/ai-chat-test` routes |
| `templates/chat.html` | ❌ Broken | Chat UI with hanging JavaScript issues |

## Routes Currently Active
- `GET /chat` - Chat page (loads but non-functional)
- `POST /ai-chat` - Main AI chat endpoint (hanging/timeout issues)
- `POST /ai-chat-test` - Test endpoint (added for debugging)

## Issues Identified
1. **Frontend hanging** - XMLHttpRequest/fetch requests never complete
2. **No backend requests** - POST requests not reaching `/ai-chat` endpoint
3. **Complex timeout system** - Multiple overlapping timeout mechanisms causing conflicts
4. **Integration complexity** - Chat system conflicts with existing FinBrain AI routing

## Working Components
- ✅ Expense form (Quick Add) - fully functional
- ✅ Expense list display - working via HTMX
- ✅ User registration/login - operational
- ✅ Core PWA functionality - stable

## Freeze Decision
Chat functionality will be disabled to:
- Eliminate hanging UI issues
- Stop interference with working features  
- Allow focus on core expense tracking functionality
- Create stable foundation for future chat implementation

## Future Implementation Notes
- Consider simpler approach without complex AI routing integration
- Test with basic echo responses before adding AI
- Implement proper timeout handling at infrastructure level
- Separate chat concerns from core expense functionality
