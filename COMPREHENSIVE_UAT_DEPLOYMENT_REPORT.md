## DETAILED WORKFLOW VALIDATION

### üáßüá© Bengali Expense Workflow (6/6 Steps PASS)

**Test Message:** `‡¶Ü‡¶ú ‡¶ö‡¶æ ‡ß´‡ß¶ ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ ‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡¶ö ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶õ‡¶ø` (I spent 50 taka on tea today)

| Step | Component | Status | Details |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Signal Extraction | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly identified money pattern "50 ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ", normalized Bengali digits |
| 2 | Security Sanitization | ‚úÖ PASS | No security threats detected, Bengali text preserved |
| 3 | Routing Decision | ‚úÖ PASS | **CRITICAL FIX:** Now routes to SMALLTALK (expense logging) instead of ANALYSIS |
| 4 | AI Processing | ‚úÖ PASS | Generated appropriate categorization response |
| 5 | Database Storage | ‚úÖ PASS | Expense stored with amount: 50.0, category: Food & Dining, currency: BDT |
| 6 | Data Integrity | ‚úÖ PASS | Amount, currency, user ID, and category consistency validated |

**Key Fix Applied:** Refined Bengali analysis pattern matching to prevent "‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡¶ö" (expense) from triggering analysis routing when used in expense logging context.

### üá∫üá∏ English Analysis Workflow (5/5 Steps PASS)

**Test Message:** `show me spending analysis for this month`

| Step | Component | Status | Details |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Analysis Signal Extraction | ‚úÖ PASS | Detected explicit analysis request, time window, analysis terms |
| 2 | Analysis Routing | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly routed to ANALYSIS intent with 95% confidence |
| 3 | Data Aggregation | ‚úÖ PASS | Generated spending totals: ‡ß≥25,000 total, 23 expenses across categories |
| 4 | AI Insight Generation | ‚úÖ PASS | Produced 3 meaningful bullet points for financial analysis |
| 5 | Response Formatting | ‚úÖ PASS | Properly formatted analysis response with data summary |

### üåê Mixed Language Coaching Workflow (3/3 Steps PASS)

**Test Message:** `help me ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶≠ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá this month` (help me save money this month)

| Step | Component | Status | Details |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Mixed Language Extraction | ‚úÖ PASS | Detected coaching verbs in both English and Bengali |
| 2 | Coaching Routing | ‚úÖ PASS | **CRITICAL FIX:** Now correctly routes to COACHING instead of ANALYSIS |
| 3 | Coaching Response | ‚úÖ PASS | Generated personalized coaching with spending insights (‡ß≥18,000 tracked) |

**Key Fix Applied:** Implemented conservative analysis routing requiring both time window AND analysis terms, allowing coaching intent to take precedence.

### ‚ùì FAQ & Admin Workflow (2/2 Steps PASS)

| Step | Component | Status | Details |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | FAQ Workflow | ‚úÖ PASS | "what can you do" ‚Üí FAQ intent |
| 2 | Admin Workflow | ‚úÖ PASS | "/id" ‚Üí ADMIN intent |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Error Handling (4/4 Cases PASS)

| Very Long Message (3000 chars) | ‚úÖ PASS | Truncated to 2000 chars safely |
| Malicious Input `<script>alert('xss')</script>` | ‚úÖ PASS | HTML escaped, safe for processing |

## CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Bengali Expense Routing Fix
**Problem:** `‡¶Ü‡¶ú ‡¶ö‡¶æ ‡ß´‡ß¶ ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ ‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡¶ö ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶õ‡¶ø` incorrectly routed to ANALYSIS  
**Solution:** Removed overly aggressive "‡¶ñ‡¶∞‡¶ö" pattern from Bengali analysis terms  
**Result:** Expense logging messages now correctly route to SMALLTALK  

### 2. Coaching Priority Fix  
**Problem:** `help me ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶≠ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá this month` routed to ANALYSIS due to time window  
**Solution:** Conservative analysis routing requiring both time window AND analysis terms  
**Result:** Coaching requests correctly take precedence over analysis  

### 3. Pattern Matching Refinement
**Problem:** Too many false positives in analysis detection  
**Solution:** Stricter pattern matching with context-aware exclusions  
**Result:** More accurate intent classification across all languages
