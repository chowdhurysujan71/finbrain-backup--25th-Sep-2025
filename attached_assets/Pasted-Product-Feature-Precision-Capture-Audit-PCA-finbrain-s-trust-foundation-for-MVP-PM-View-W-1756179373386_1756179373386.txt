Product Feature: Precision Capture & Audit (PCA)

finbrain’s trust foundation for MVP

🎯 PM View: Why This Matters

Users will forgive missing features, but they will not forgive incorrect money tracking. Our MVP promise must be:

“Every expense you log is captured. You can always see what really happened. And if the AI makes a mistake, you can fix it instantly.”

This is not about bells and whistles — it’s about trust. If we lose trust once, we don’t get a second chance.

What the feature delivers to the user:

Immutable Ledger: Their raw input is always saved. Nothing disappears.

Personal Corrections: Fixes apply only to their view, not anyone else’s.

Audit Transparency: They can see the original vs corrected record.

Confidence & Clarifiers: If the system is unsure, it asks them, instead of guessing wrong.

Consistency: Every response comes from the database, not from a guess — what they see is what’s stored.

Safety: If anything fails, the system quietly falls back to today’s working path.

🛠 CTO View: How We Deliver Without Risk

Priority: do not break the current system. Everything we add is overlay, flag-gated, and reversible.

Architecture Principles

Raw never touched: Current transactions_raw continues as-is (append-only).

Overlay tables: New user-facing truth (transactions_effective, user_corrections, user_rules) live separately.

Canonical Command (CC): Every input → CC object (intent, slots, confidence, decision) → snapshot stored before any DB write.

Feature Flags: SHADOW (log only), DRYRUN (safe preview), ON (real overlay writes). Kill switch toggles instantly back to legacy.

Fallback Path: If PCA fails, legacy pipeline handles input. Users never notice a failure.

Build Order (minimize blast radius)

Overlay Schema (Day 1–2)

Add user_corrections, transactions_effective, user_rules.

No reads/writes yet — invisible to system.

Risk = none.

Canonical Command & Snapshot (Day 3)

All messages → CC object → snapshot.

Still route writes via old system.

Risk = none (shadow only).

Feature Flags (Day 4)

Wrap PCA in SHADOW, DRYRUN, ON, FALLBACK.

Allows controlled testing.

Risk = none (flags default OFF).

Confidence Thresholds + Clarifier (Day 5)

Introduce simple τ_high / τ_low.

If unsure, ask chip; otherwise auto log.

Safe because raw always logged.

Audit UI Surfacing (Day 6)

Show “Original vs Corrected (your view)”.

Read-only UI change.

Canary Rollout (Day 7)

Turn PCA ON for ≤100 users.

Monitor correction rate, fallback triggers, latency.

Kill switch always available.

✅ Net Result for MVP

User experience:

They always see what got logged.

They can fix errors instantly.

They gain confidence that finbrain is reliable with their money.

System safety:

Current raw logging remains untouched.

New features live in overlays + flags, so they can be switched off at any moment.

Failures fall back to current working flow.

PM win: Trust & engagement loops now have a solid foundation.

CTO win: Zero core-risk, progressive rollout, auditable changes.

💡 In Google PM terms: This feature is the “SafeSearch” of finbrain’s MVP — it doesn’t add glamour, but it guarantees reliability. In CTO terms: It’s an overlay layer with feature flags — meaning it’s impossible to break the ledger.
