Block 6 – Acceptance Criteria (Non-Tech)
1. Challenge Start

When a user types “START 3D”, the challenge begins.

The system confirms clearly:
“Welcome to the 3-Day Money Story Challenge. Log daily expenses for the next 3 days to complete it.”

Challenge start date is saved, and only one challenge can be active per user at a time.

Analytics logs: challenge_started.

✅ Pass if: User receives one clear welcome message, challenge state is active, and analytics shows one start event.

2. Daily Progress (Policy-Compliant)

On Day 2 and Day 3, when the user sends any message:

System checks their challenge status.

If eligible, it appends a motivational nudge to the normal response:
“Day 2/3 — keep logging, you’re on track!”

No proactive messages are sent outside user interactions.

✅ Pass if: Users see progress nudges only during interactions, never as unsolicited pushes.

3. Expense Logging During Challenge

Every logged expense during the challenge counts toward progress.

Logging continues to work as normal, with no delays or errors.

Analytics continues to capture each log.

✅ Pass if: Expenses are saved normally, and challenge progress reflects logs accurately.

4. Challenge Completion

At the end of Day 3, the system automatically checks progress.

If completed (≥1 log each day), user receives a single completion report:
“✅ Challenge Complete! Here’s your 3-Day Money Story: …”

Report is generated once, and cannot duplicate.

Analytics logs: challenge_completed + report_requested.

✅ Pass if: Exactly one completion report is delivered, and both analytics events are captured once.

5. Idempotency & Reliability

If a user tries to start multiple challenges, only the first one is active.

If a user logs multiple expenses rapidly, progress updates correctly with no duplicates.

If a user reopens Messenger on Day 4+, challenge is marked complete and no more nudges are shown.

✅ Pass if: No duplicate challenges, no duplicate reports, no nudges after completion.

6. Analytics & Tracking

Events recorded:

challenge_started (once at start)

challenge_completed (once at finish)

report_requested (when final report is delivered)

All analytics events follow existing naming conventions and appear in the same dashboards as milestones.

✅ Pass if: Each event appears once in telemetry, cleanly separated from D1/D3/milestones.

7. User Experience

Language is simple, encouraging, and consistent with other system messages.

Users never feel spammed (nudges only show up when they message first).

If users abandon the challenge midway, system stops nudging after end date.

✅ Pass if: Experience feels smooth and natural, without unexpected or repeated messages.

Progress → Nudges shown only when users interact (policy-safe).

Completion → Exactly one final report, no duplicates.
