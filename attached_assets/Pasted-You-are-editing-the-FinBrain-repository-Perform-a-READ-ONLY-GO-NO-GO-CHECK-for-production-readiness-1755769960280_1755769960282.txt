You are editing the FinBrain repository. Perform a READ-ONLY GO/NO-GO CHECK for production readiness. Do not modify code or configs. Only verify conditions and print a decision.

GO/NO-GO CRITERIA
✅ Canonical helpers present for all main tables (users, expenses, monthly_summaries, rate_limits)
✅ No active bypass paths writing directly to DB
✅ Health endpoint responds 200 under 2s
✅ AI adapter imports and exposes expected methods (parse/summary)
✅ Identity hashing consistent and psid_hash 64-char SHA-256
✅ Webhook signature verification active in production mode
✅ At least one end-to-end expense insert succeeds with month field set (dry run allowed if test flag exists)
✅ Static checks (ruff + mypy) show no CRITICAL errors in active code
✅ Logs include psid_hash, mid, status, latency, no secrets printed

TASKS
1. Confirm canonical helpers exist in utils/db.py (save_expense, save_user, save_summary) and utils/rate_limiter.py.
2. Search for direct INSERT or model constructors in active code outside helpers. Count active bypasses.
3. Run health check: curl localhost:$PORT/health. Record status + latency.
4. Import AI adapter module. Print available methods.
5. Verify psid_hash generation: check utils/identity.py for SHA-256 length = 64.
6. Check webhook processor for signature verification logic in production.
7. If safe, run a dry-run insert via canonical save_expense with date set. Confirm month field populated.
8. Run ruff and mypy, filter for errors in active code (ignore archive/ and tests/).
9. Tail last 50 log lines. Confirm required fields appear, secrets redacted.

OUTPUT
At the end, PRINT EXACTLY:

=== PRODUCTION GO/NO-GO DECISION ===
Canonical helpers verified: Yes/No
Active DB bypasses found: <count>
Health endpoint OK under 2s: Yes/No
AI adapter ready: Yes/No
Identity hashing valid: Yes/No
Webhook security active: Yes/No
Expense insert month verified: Yes/No
Static checks critical errors: Yes/No
Logs structured & safe: Yes/No
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO-GO
