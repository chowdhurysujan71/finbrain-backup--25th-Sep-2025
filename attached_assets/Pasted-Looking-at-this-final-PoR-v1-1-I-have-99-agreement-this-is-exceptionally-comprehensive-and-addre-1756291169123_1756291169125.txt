Looking at this final PoR v1.1, I have 99% agreement - this is exceptionally comprehensive and addresses every single concern from our previous discussions. We are essentially 100% in alignment.

Complete Concern Resolution ✅
1. FAQ Scope Breadth (Previously 🟡 Now ✅)
Before: Too narrow patterns
Now: Massively expanded - "what can you do|how does it work|features|capabilities|privacy|security|pricing|cost|subscription"
Impact: Covers actual user FAQ patterns comprehensively
2. Mixed-Language Edge Cases (Previously 🟡 Now ✅)
Before: Unclear how "আজকের analysis please" would route
Now: Explicit dual pattern evaluation with re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE
Impact: Robust handling of mixed EN/BN queries
3. Data Version Hash Stability (Previously 🟡 Now ✅)
Before: Concern about amount changes with same categories
Now: TWO approaches provided - strong fingerprint AND lightweight fallback with SUM + MAX(updated_at)
Impact: Catches all meaningful data changes while being performant
4. PCA Integration (Previously ✅ Maintained ✅)
Precedence: ADMIN → PCA_AUDIT → ANALYSIS maintains audit compliance
Overlay Compatibility: Works seamlessly with existing PCA flags
Impact: Zero conflict with regulatory/audit requirements
5. Coaching Session Override (Previously 🟡 Now ✅)
Logic: in_coaching_session AND explicit_analysis_request → ANALYSIS
Examples: "বিশ্লেষণ দাও", "spending summary" work even during coaching
Impact: Users retain control during coaching sessions
Technical Excellence Indicators
Production Readiness
✅ Conservative rollout (zero_ledger_only first)
✅ Instant rollback mechanism (ROUTER_MODE=ai_first)
✅ Preserves all existing safety mechanisms
✅ Uses existing PCA overlay infrastructure
✅ 60+ contract tests with CI integration
Bilingual Robustness
✅ Comprehensive EN/BN keyword sets
✅ Mixed-language query handling
✅ Unicode-aware regex compilation
✅ Bilingual uniqueness messaging
Data Integrity
✅ Strong fingerprint with ID + amount + category + merchant + timestamp
✅ Lightweight fallback with COUNT + SUM + MAX(updated_at)
✅ Addresses amount changes, category changes, and timing changes
✅ Truthful uniqueness messaging with helpful micro-insights
Risk Assessment: Minimal
Deployment Risk: Near Zero
Phase 1 affects only users with zero ledger (safest cohort)
Instant rollback without redeploy
Preserves all contamination safeguards
UX Risk: Minimal
Maintains coaching session continuity
Provides explicit analysis override
Truthful messaging about unchanged data
Technical Risk: Minimal
Additive architecture (sits before existing handlers)
All existing logic preserved
Comprehensive monitoring and acceptance criteria
Final Assessment
Agreement Level: 99% ✅

The remaining 1% is not disagreement but implementation verification:

Regex pattern testing in production environment
Performance validation of data-version queries
Contract test execution across all 60+ phrases
This plan successfully achieves:

Engineering Rigor: Deterministic routing with proper state awareness
Business Safety: Conservative rollout with instant rollback
Architecture Respect: Leverages existing PCA/overlay infrastructure
User Experience: Maintains intelligence while adding reliability
Recommendation: This is ready for immediate Phase 1 implementation. The plan balances innovation with safety exceptionally well.

We are 100% aligned on the strategic direction and technical approach.
