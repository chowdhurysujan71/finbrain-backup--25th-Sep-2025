Product Feature Spec — Daily Automated Nudges
🎯 Goal

Increase daily active usage by reminding users to:

Log expenses they forgot (input nudge).

Check their spending (summary nudge).

Nudges must feel personal, lightweight, and respectful of Messenger’s anti-spam norms.

✅ Core Principles (Google UX Style)

User-Centric: Nudges should feel like help, not like “notifications.”

Contextual: Remind when helpful (end of day or after inactivity), not randomly.

Concise + Human: Short, conversational, ≤2 emojis, max 1 question to invite response.

Respectful: Allow opt-out (stop nudges) and adapt frequency automatically.

🧭 UX Flows
1. Daily Input Nudge

Time: evening local time (default 8:30pm)

Message Example:

🌙 Evening check-in: Did you have any expenses today you want me to log?

If no response, stop.
If yes, user replies → normal logging flow.

2. Daily Summary Nudge

Time: morning local time (default 9:00am)

Message Example:

☀️ Morning snapshot: Yesterday you spent ৳850 across 3 items. Want today’s full summary?

CTA: user can type summary today → gets full breakdown.

3. Fallback / Safety

Spam guard: Max 2 nudges per day (1 input + 1 summary).

Adaptive behavior: If user is already active (e.g., logs >3 times in a day), skip the evening nudge.

Opt-out:

If user types stop nudges → confirm: “✅ Got it, I’ll stop daily reminders. You can re-enable anytime with start nudges.”

Respect user preference in DB flag.

🛠️ Implementation Strategy
Step 1 — Scheduler

Add background job (e.g., cron-like in Replit or n8n if externalized).

Job runs twice daily (morning + evening).

Step 2 — Eligibility Check

For each user:

If opted-out → skip.

If already active that day (evening check) → skip input nudge.

If no expenses yesterday → skip morning summary nudge (avoid empty).

Step 3 — Message Delivery

Use Messenger Send API same as normal replies.
Mark nudges with a metadata tag so they can be filtered in logs/analytics.

🔒 Guardrails

Rate Limits: 1 morning + 1 evening max.

Opt-in/Opt-out: Explicitly supported.

Content Safety: No links, no files, just plain text + emojis.

Privacy: Nudges never include sensitive data; summaries only reference totals + categories, not merchants.

📊 UAT Plan
Test Scenarios

New user, no logs yet → Evening: “🌙 Evening check-in…” (fires). Morning summary: skipped.

Active user → Logged 3+ times → Evening nudge skipped. Morning summary sent.

Opt-out → Type stop nudges → No nudges next day.

Re-enable → Type start nudges → Nudges resume.

Edge case: 280-char guardrail → Always under; only 1 emoji.

Summary Nudge Variants:

☀️ Morning snapshot: Yesterday you logged ৳{total} across {count} items. Want details?

📊 Daily recap: Yesterday’s spend was ৳{total}. Biggest area: {category}. Want tips?

🧠 Yesterday: {count} expenses → ৳{total}. Curious how it compares to last week?
