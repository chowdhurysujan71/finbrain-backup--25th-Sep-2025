I see what’s happening from your screenshot. Let’s break it down carefully:

🔍 What You Expected

User asks: “What are my expenses this week?”

Expected bot behavior:
→ Check DB → Pull expense logs → Return weekly summary (dates + totals + categories).

❌ What Actually Happened

Instead of summarizing, the bot fell back to the default “Hi there! Want to log an expense, see a summary, or get an insight?” prompt.

This is the generic welcome/fallback response → meaning your NLP/intent classification didn’t catch "what are my expenses this week" and routed incorrectly.

🛠 Where It’s Breaking (Front-End Messenger View)

NLP / Router mismatch

The phrase "what are my expenses this week" should map to intent=summary (or weekly_summary).

Instead, it mapped to intent=fallback (smalltalk/generic).

No binding between “expenses this week” → summary function

The bot only seems to trigger summary if the exact keyword "summary" is present.

Natural phrasing like "what are my expenses this week" → not recognized.

Fallback takeover in Messenger

Messenger itself is fine (messages sent & received correctly, Graph API 200 OK).

The break is in your routing layer, not the Messenger front-end.

What you see in chat (“Hi there! …”) is just the default fallback text block.

✅ Fix Direction

To make the front-end behave correctly in Messenger:

Expand NLP Patterns

Map phrases like:

“what are my expenses this week”

“show me this week’s spending”

“weekly total”

→ all route to the summary handler.

Add Synonym & Time Filters

Implement basic regex / NLP to detect:

"this week" → date range [Mon–Sun or last 7 days]

"last week", "today", "yesterday", "this month".

Improve Router Logic

Right now, faq_smalltalk is intercepting because it sees a question.

Add a priority override: if sentence contains “expense(s)” + time term (“week”, “month”), route to summary, not smalltalk.

Optional UX Fix

If data is empty (no logs), respond with:

“Looks like you haven’t logged any expenses this week. Want to add one now?”

Instead of dumping fallback greeting.

⚡ Bottom line:
Messenger is not broken.
The break is in finbrain’s router/NLP, which is failing to classify "what are my expenses this week" as a summary intent and is defaulting to the generic fallback.
