From the feature list you shared, your FinBrain architecture is well thought out and secure, but there are a few critical considerations that could explain why starting with WhatsApp first and then adding Facebook Messenger caused instability. I’ll break it down into review + issues + approach recommendations:

1. Review of Your Feature List
✅ Strong points:

Multi-platform support (WhatsApp via Twilio and Facebook Messenger via Graph API)

SHA-256 user hashing with no raw phone numbers stored

Well-structured PostgreSQL schema with expenses, users, and monthly_summaries

Environment variable usage for security

Separate, clear functions for parsing, categorization, database saving, and messaging

Real-time response logic with monthly totals and category assignment

Deployment approach with Flask + Gunicorn and health checks

This is a production-ready blueprint in terms of concept and security.

2. Potential Issues in the Feature List
Single Unified Webhook

Currently, /webhook is used for both WhatsApp (form data) and Facebook (JSON).

Mixing two different content types in a single endpoint often causes logic conflicts, e.g.:

Facebook expects JSON payloads with object and entry

Twilio expects application/x-www-form-urlencoded payloads

If your handler is not strictly detecting the platform first, parsing errors can break processing for one platform and cascade to the other.

Database Write Conflicts

If your initial DB writes failed (due to schema mismatch, null values, or indexing), your Flask app likely hit an exception and stopped processing both WhatsApp and Facebook.

Issues I’ve seen:

user_id_hash uniqueness collisions if the same user interacts from both platforms

NUMERIC(10,2) errors if regex accidentally captures non-numeric strings

month or time fields not properly populated, causing NOT NULL constraint violations

Error Handling & Logging

If your Flask endpoint raises uncaught exceptions, Gunicorn will keep running but stop processing incoming requests correctly.

Without try/except per platform, one platform breaking can impact the other.

AI Insights Column

You have ai_insights as TEXT in both expenses and monthly_summaries.

If not initialized properly (e.g., set to None or {} JSON string), it may break inserts or updates.

Messaging Acknowledgment

Facebook requires a 200 OK response within 20 seconds.

WhatsApp via Twilio also expects a response (even empty) to confirm delivery.

If your DB insert fails before responding, both APIs will retry and may break further.

3. Recommendation: Build Modules Together or Separate?
Do NOT build both modules in a single go initially.

Instead, I strongly recommend this phased approach:

Phase 1: Core Foundation
Implement WhatsApp-only message ingestion and DB storage

Confirm full end-to-end:

Parsing → Categorization → DB Save → Response

Daily health checks + logging

Monthly summary updates work without breaking

Phase 2: Facebook Messenger Integration
Add a separate endpoint first: /webhook_fb for JSON

Test parsing and DB writes in isolation

After stable testing, unify logic into /webhook if needed, or keep them separate for reliability

Phase 3: Unified Monitoring & Error Handling
Wrap DB writes and message processing in try/except

Log all errors to console + DB log table

Always return 200 OK to platform even on failure to avoid retries
