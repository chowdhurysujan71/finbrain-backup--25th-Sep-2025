# SMART_CORRECTIONS Implementation Completion Report

## Executive Summary

The SMART_CORRECTIONS system has been successfully implemented and integrated into FinBrain, providing users with natural language correction capabilities for expense entries. The system allows users to correct previous expenses using phrases like "sorry, I meant 500" and "actually 300 for coffee".

## Implementation Completed

### âœ… Core Components

1. **Enhanced Money Detection with Correction Fallback**
   - Location: `finbrain/router.py`
   - Function: `contains_money_with_correction_fallback()`
   - Features: Detects bare numbers (500, 25.50) and k shorthand (1.5k) in correction messages
   - Safety: Only activates when SMART_CORRECTIONS enabled AND message is a correction

2. **Correction Message Detection**
   - Location: `parsers/expense.py`
   - Function: `is_correction_message()`
   - Patterns: "sorry", "i meant", "actually", "typo", "should be", "correct that", etc.
   - Compiled regex for performance

3. **Enhanced Expense Parser with Correction Context**
   - Location: `parsers/expense.py` 
   - Function: `parse_expense(correction_context=True)`
   - Features: Supports bare numbers, field inheritance from candidates
   - Returns: Parsed amount with None fields to be inherited from original expense

4. **Comprehensive Correction Handler**
   - Location: `handlers/expense.py`
   - Function: `handle_correction()`
   - Features: 
     - 10-minute correction window
     - Intelligent candidate matching (category + merchant similarity)
     - Supersede logic (marks original as superseded rather than deleting)
     - Duplicate correction protection
     - Field inheritance from original expense
     - Comprehensive error handling

### âœ… Production Router Integration

1. **Router Precedence Logic**
   - Priority: CORRECTION â†’ LOG â†’ SUMMARY 
   - Location: `utils/production_router.py`
   - Logic: Corrections detected first, before regular money detection

2. **Feature Flag Integration**
   - Location: `utils/feature_flags.py`
   - Flags: `SMART_CORRECTIONS_DEFAULT` (defaults to False)
   - Allowlist: `FEATURE_ALLOWLIST_SMART_CORRECTIONS` for canary deployment
   - Function: `is_smart_corrections_enabled(psid_hash)`

### âœ… Database Schema Support

1. **Supersede Logic Fields**
   - `superseded_by` (Integer, nullable) - Points to correcting expense
   - `corrected_at` (DateTime, nullable) - When correction occurred  
   - `corrected_reason` (String, nullable) - Reason for correction
   - Backwards compatible - existing expenses unaffected

2. **Idempotency Protection**
   - Unique constraint on `(psid_hash, mid)` prevents duplicate corrections
   - Message ID tracking ensures one correction per message

### âœ… User Experience Components

1. **Coach-Style Reply Templates**
   - Location: `templates/replies.py`
   - Templates: Success, no candidate, duplicate, error scenarios
   - Examples: "âœ… Corrected: à§³100 â†’ à§³500 for food at Starbucks"

2. **Comprehensive Telemetry**
   - Location: `utils/structured.py`
   - Events: Detection, application, no candidate, duplicates
   - Structured JSON logging for debugging and analytics

### âœ… Safety and Quality Assurance

1. **Feature Flag System**
   - Default: OFF (zero-downgrade deployment)
   - Canary: Allowlist-based rollout to specific users
   - Instant rollback: Set `SMART_CORRECTIONS_DEFAULT=false`

2. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Location: `tests/test_smart_corrections.py`
   - Coverage: Detection, parsing, matching, replies, edge cases
   - Unit and integration tests

3. **Development Simulation Script**
   - Location: `scripts/dev_simulate_correction.py`
   - End-to-end testing with realistic scenarios
   - JSON results output for CI/CD integration

## Key Features Delivered

### ðŸŽ¯ Natural Language Corrections
- "sorry, I meant 500" - Corrects amount to 500
- "actually 1.5k" - Corrects using k shorthand
- "typo, should be 25.50" - Decimal precision support

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Candidate Matching
- Finds best expense to correct within 10-minute window
- Similarity scoring based on category and merchant
- Falls back to most recent if no semantic match

### ðŸŽ¯ Field Inheritance System
- Missing currency â†’ inherited from original
- Missing category â†’ inherited from original
- Missing merchant â†’ inherited from original
- Only amount specified â†’ other fields preserved

### ðŸŽ¯ Supersede Logic (Not Deletion)
- Original expenses marked as `superseded_by` new expense
- Data integrity preserved for audit trails
- User totals updated correctly (removes old, adds new)

### ðŸŽ¯ Coach-Style Confirmations
- "âœ… Corrected: à§³100 â†’ à§³500 for food"
- "Got it! I didn't find a recent expense to correct, so I've logged à§³500 for food as a new expense"
- Natural, helpful language matching FinBrain's tone

## Integration Points

### Production Router Flow
```
1. Message received
2. Correction detection (if SMART_CORRECTIONS enabled)
3. Enhanced money detection with fallback
4. Correction handler or regular expense logging
5. Coach-style reply with confirmation
```

### Database Operations
```
1. Parse correction message
2. Find candidates in 10-minute window  
3. Score candidates by similarity
4. Create new corrected expense
5. Mark original as superseded
6. Update user totals atomically
```

   FEATURE_ALLOWLIST_SMART_CORRECTIONS=""  # Empty for global disable
   ```

2. **Canary Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Enable for specific test users
   FEATURE_ALLOWLIST_SMART_CORRECTIONS="user_hash_1,user_hash_2"
   ```

3. **Monitoring**
   - Watch structured logs for correction events
   - Monitor error rates and fallback usage
   - Track user adoption and success rates

4. **Gradual Rollout**
   ```bash
   # After canary validation, enable globally
   SMART_CORRECTIONS_DEFAULT=true
   ```

The SMART_CORRECTIONS system enhances FinBrain's user experience by providing natural, intelligent expense correction capabilities while maintaining the system's reliability and safety standards.
