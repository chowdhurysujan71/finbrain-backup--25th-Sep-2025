# FinBrain Security Audit

**Audit Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Audit Type**: READ-ONLY Security Assessment

## Security Checklist

| Security Control | Status | Notes |
|------------------|---------|-------|
| Signature verification active in production | ✅ PASS | X-Hub-Signature-256 verification implemented |
| Secrets in logs | ✅ PASS | No raw secrets found in log outputs |
| Dependency CVEs summary | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | Security tools not available for scan |
| Dev bypass gated | ✅ PASS | ENV checks properly gate dev features |
| Debug endpoints disabled in production | ✅ PASS | Health endpoint only, admin protected |

## Findings

### ✅ Webhook Security
- Facebook signature verification implemented via `X-Hub-Signature-256`
- HTTPS enforcement active
- Token monitoring enabled

### ✅ Development Bypasses
- Dev PSID allowlist properly gated by `ENV != "production"` check
- Development features disabled in production environment

### ⚠️ Potential Security Concerns
- 17,653 matches for potential secrets patterns (includes dependencies)
- Security scanning tools (bandit, safety) not available for comprehensive scan
- OpenAI API key missing (may affect AI functionality)

### ✅ Environment Security
- Required environment variables properly configured
- No secrets exposed in logs or health endpoints
- Database connection secured via environment variables

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**: Run security scan with bandit/safety tools
2. **Medium Priority**: Review and minimize secret pattern matches
3. **Low Priority**: Consider implementing additional rate limiting for security endpoints
