**Verdict: PASS**

**Artifacts:**
- A1 (Type/Lint): utils/db.py compiles ✓, critical runtime scan PASS ✓
- A2 (Core flows): get_user_expenses function verified ✓
- A3 (Router logs): N/A - focused on utils/db.py verification
- A4 (Code audit): Legacy methods properly removed ✓
- A5 (Cache headers): Cache-Control: no-store verified ✓

**Facts observed:**
• utils/db.py line 93: user_id_hash parameter correctly used in query
• Line 25,29,57: All database operations use user_id_hash consistently
• Compilation: ✓ Clean (py_compile successful)
• Critical lint: ✓ F821/E722 clean on runtime paths
• Legacy audit: save_expense/upsert_expense properly removed (comments only)

**Open risks:**
• LOW: F401 unused import 'datetime' - cosmetic only, not runtime affecting

**utils/db.py status: PASS** - user_id_hash fix verified with evidence
