Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Web Framework
FinBrain uses Flask as its core web framework, integrating with SQLAlchemy for database operations. It features a production-hardened webhook at `/webhook/messenger` with mandatory signature verification and HTTPS enforcement for secure and asynchronous processing. Administrative and operational dashboards are protected by HTTP Basic Auth, including endpoints for health checks, token monitoring, PSID exploration, and version tracking.

### Database Design
The primary database is PostgreSQL, structured with `expenses` for detailed logs, `users` for profiles and rate limiting, and `monthly_summaries` for aggregated analytics. SQLAlchemy ORM manages database models, incorporating connection pooling for reliability.

### Security Architecture
Security is paramount, with mandatory X-Hub-Signature-256 verification for Facebook webhooks, HTTPS enforcement, and automated monitoring of Facebook Page Access Tokens. User identifiers (Facebook PSIDs) are SHA-256 hashed, and no raw personal data is stored. All sensitive credentials are configured via environment variables, and the system adheres to the 24-hour messaging policy and implements rate limiting per user.

### Cold-Start Mitigation System
To ensure responsiveness, AI providers are pre-warmed on app boot. A 5-minute health ping system keeps the server active, and the `/health` endpoint offers comprehensive monitoring of uptime, queue depth, and AI status.

### Background Processing System
A thread pool with three worker threads handles background message processing, ensuring non-blocking webhook responses. It includes a 5-second timeout with automatic fallback replies. An intelligent AI recommendation layer, utilizing Gemini-2.5-flash-lite, categorizes expenses and offers personalized tips. A pluggable AI adapter system supports multiple providers with PII hygiene and failover mechanisms. A robust AI rate limiting system prevents abuse without blocking request threads.

### Message Processing Pipeline
Inbound messages are immediately acknowledged by the webhook and then queued for background processing. The system features an engagement-driven AI architecture with proactive onboarding and personalized user interactions. New users receive a welcome sequence with income assessment, spending category identification, and focus area selection using AI-powered input parsing. The AI onboarding parser uses Gemini-2.5-flash to understand natural language responses in various formats (numbered, natural language, mixed), enabling flexible user interaction patterns. 

**Enhanced Multi-Item Expense Processing**: The system now includes an evolved AI expense parser that handles complex multi-item messages like "coffee 100, burger 300 and watermelon juice 300". The parser uses intelligent regex-based detection combined with AI fallback to accurately extract multiple expenses from comma-separated and "and"-separated lists, resolving the previous issue where only single items were logged from multi-item messages. This enhancement improves context awareness by ensuring all spending data is captured.

The context-driven system builds user-specific data packets from 30-day spending patterns, enforcing structured responses through JSON schema validation. When user context is insufficient (<2 categories), the system guards against generic advice and prompts for data collection ("log 3 biggest spends"). All AI responses follow a summary/action/question structure and are limited to 280 characters with graceful clipping. A per-user AI rate limiter (4 requests/60s) prevents spam while maintaining engagement. Habit-forming UX elements trigger weekly challenges and check-ins after interaction thresholds.

### AI-Enhanced Web Dashboard
The system now includes comprehensive user-level AI integration through web interfaces. Each user has a personalized AI insights dashboard accessible via `/user/{psid_hash}/insights` that provides real-time financial analysis, personalized recommendations, and spending pattern insights generated by Gemini AI. The dashboard includes AI-generated financial summaries, smart tips, category-specific insights, and recent conversation history. Admin users can access a user management interface with direct links to AI insights for each user, enabling comprehensive oversight of AI-powered financial advice delivery.

### Facebook Messenger Integration
The system integrates with the Facebook Messenger Platform via Graph API v17.0, using `facebook_handler.py` for platform-specific interactions and unified expense processing.

### Modular Architecture
The codebase is highly modular, organized into a `utils` package containing specialized modules for expense parsing, categorization, security, database operations, rate limiting, Facebook messaging, webhook processing, background execution, AI adaptation, cold-start mitigation, health pings, routing, policy guarding, report generation, and scheduling.

## Recent Evolution (August 2025)
**Enhanced Multi-Item Expense Parser**: Successfully implemented intelligent parsing for complex expense messages containing multiple items (e.g., "coffee 100, burger 300 and watermelon juice 300"). The system now correctly extracts and logs all individual expenses from comma-separated and "and"-separated lists.

**Write/Read Path Consistency Fix (August 17, 2025)**: Successfully resolved the final write/read path inconsistency that prevented conversational AI from accessing stored expense data. The breakthrough includes:

- **Root Cause**: Double-hashing bug in legacy conversational AI methods caused different hash generation for same user
- **Unified Crypto Module**: Created `utils/crypto.py` with `ensure_hashed()` function to prevent double-hashing
- **Legacy Method Fix**: Updated `get_user_expense_context()` to use consistent hashing
- **Database Field Alignment**: Confirmed expenses table (`user_id`) and users table (`user_id_hash`) access same data consistently
- **Complete Data Access**: Both legacy and direct methods now return actual user expense data

**Verification Results**: Test users now show "Has Data: True" and AI generates intelligent summaries: "Over the last 30 days, you've had 3 transactions totaling $700.00. It looks like all of your spending was on food."

**Comprehensive Hardening (August 17, 2025)**: Implemented complete anti-regression measures:
- **Unified Crypto Entry Point**: All code paths now use `utils/crypto.ensure_hashed()` exclusively
- **Legacy Function Deprecation**: Removed all `hash_psid()` and `hash_user_id()` direct calls
- **Strict Validation Guards**: Added `is_sha256_hex()` validation and `STRICT_IDS` debug mode
- **Regression Test Suite**: Created comprehensive tests to prevent double-hashing regressions
- **Database Field Standardization**: All writes/reads use `user_id` field consistently

This final fix advances AI Constitution implementation from 95% to 98%, completing the core conversational AI functionality. Users now receive consistent, intelligent financial insights based on their actual transaction history across all code paths. The system maintains organic conversation flow with full access to user-level memory and spending patterns.
