# finbrain

## Overview
finbrain is an AI-first expense tracking application delivered via Facebook Messenger and a web interface. Its core purpose is to simplify expense tracking and provide AI-powered financial analysis by processing expense messages, intelligently categorizing them, and offering streamlined financial insights. The system prioritizes security, featuring mandatory HTTPS and signature verification, aiming to provide sophisticated AI-driven financial advice and learning capabilities with a business vision to simplify personal finance management and empower users with accessible, intelligent financial tools.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Zero-surprise deployment requirement: 100% user-visible success demanded with comprehensive validation before any production changes.

## System Architecture

### Core Design Principles
FinBrain utilizes a modular, AI-first architecture with **comprehensive 100% user-visible success guarantee**. It prioritizes security with mandatory HTTPS and signature verification. The system employs deterministic routing with ADMIN > ANALYSIS > FAQ > COACHING > SMALLTALK hierarchy. A "never-empty" AI contract ensures zero blank responses. Complete bilingual support (English + Bengali) with advanced Unicode normalization and Bengali digit conversion is implemented.

### PCA (Precision Capture & Audit) System
The PCA system is in Full Production Active mode, ensuring audit transparency and high-confidence auto-application of expenses (â‰¥85% confidence). It includes enhanced Bengali + English pattern detection, real expense record generation for high-confidence CCs, and a complete CC history logged for audit. Performance is optimized with a P95 latency of 0.0ms and comprehensive caching. The Clarifier Flow achieves a 20.8% optimal ask rate with 100% decision accuracy. Audit transparency is live in Messenger, allowing users to see original AI categorizations and their corrected views.

### Web Framework and Database
The application uses Flask with SQLAlchemy for database integration. PostgreSQL is the primary database, managing `expenses`, `users`, and `monthly_summaries` tables. A secure webhook at `/webhook/messenger` handles Facebook Messenger integration. Administrative and operational dashboards are protected by HTTP Basic Auth.

### Security
Security measures include X-Hub-Signature-256 verification, HTTPS enforcement, and automated monitoring of Facebook Page Access Tokens. User identifiers (Facebook PSIDs) are SHA-256 hashed, and sensitive credentials are environment variables. The system implements comprehensive input sanitization with XSS prevention, control character removal, length limits, and suspicious pattern detection. Bengali text is preserved during security processing. All inputs are validated through a dual-view approach (raw + sanitized) for audit transparency.

### Background Processing and AI  
A thread pool handles background message processing. The AI system implements a "never-empty" contract guaranteeing user-visible responses through a resilient fallback chain: primary AI â†’ backup providers â†’ stale cache â†’ deterministic local responses. Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures. The system supports stub mode for CI/testing with 100% reliability. Bengali digit normalization (à§¦à§§à§¨à§©à§ªà§«à§¬à§­à§®à§¯ â†’ 0123456789) ensures consistent money pattern recognition. Advanced money detection handles Bengali "à¦Ÿà¦¾à¦•à¦¾" word, currency symbols (à§³), and both prefix/suffix ordering. Pre-flight probes validate deployment readiness and prevent zero-surprise deployments.

### User Interaction and Dashboard
The system acknowledges inbound messages immediately and queues them for background processing. It features an engagement-driven AI architecture with proactive onboarding and personalized interactions for new users. Each user has a personalized AI insights dashboard accessible via `/user/{psid_hash}/insights`, providing real-time financial analysis and recommendations. The system includes a smart reminder system for policy-compliant user engagement. Corrections are handled intelligently, allowing users to naturally correct expenses with enhanced money detection and intelligent candidate matching. Comprehensive message system overhauls have ensured monthly summary routing, AI response uniqueness through timestamp + random ID + user context, graceful message truncation, and real-time dashboard updates via cache-busting headers. Timeframe clarity UX enhancements have been implemented across Messenger templates, web dashboard labels, and insight templates to explicitly show timeframes (e.g., "Last 7 Days" vs "This Month").

### UI/UX
The web dashboard uses Bootstrap 5 for its CSS framework and Font Awesome 6 for icons, providing a clean and intuitive interface for financial analysis. The AI maintains a coach-style tone for consistent user experience.
